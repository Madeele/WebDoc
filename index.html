                    Mr. Russ is engaged in the production of the keys and shoes for more than 30 years.
                    1986 was the year, when Mr. Russ decided to break the walls between him and the customers. <br> <br>However the manager position was well paid, it did not guarantee him happiness. Therefore he built his own company, where he could be in real contact with the people.
